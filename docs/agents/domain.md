# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This repo is **single-context**: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/`, both at the repo root, covering the whole workspace (`packages/core`, `packages/charts`, `packages/table` and `packages/demo`).

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/
│   │   ├── 0001-<slug>.md
│   │   └── 0002-<slug>.md
│   └── agents/
└── packages/
    ├── core/
    ├── charts/
    ├── table/
    └── demo/
```

If the packages ever diverge into genuinely separate domains with their own vocabularies, switch to multi-context: a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at `packages/<name>/CONTEXT.md`, each with its own `packages/<name>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions, and keep root `docs/adr/` for workspace-wide decisions.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
