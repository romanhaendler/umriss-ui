/* The outline of the demo - in one place.

   It is data, not markup: the sidebar, the jump palette, the
   page head, the props tables and the screenshot suite all read from it. Two
   lists that mean the same thing drift apart.

   On naming. A page is called what a developer searches the component by - by
   its name and not by a category. Composite parts stand with their parent:
   `CardHeader` with `Card`, `SplitButton` with `ButtonGroup`. Whoever looks
   for `CardHeader` finds it where it is used anyway.

   On the address. It is single-segment: `#/button`. The rubric is
   deliberately NOT in it. A rubric sorts the sidebar and means nothing inside
   the library; were it in the address, every re-sorting of the sidebar would
   break every link (CONTEXT.md, "Rubric"). Component names are unique across
   the library, so one segment is enough.

   What is NOT here: the examples. They come from the files under
   `demo/examples/` and from nothing else - a list beside them would be exactly
   the second truth this head argues against.

   On the cut. The rubrics of the demo rework (.scratch/demo-rework/spec.md):
   Getting started, Layout, Typography, Actions, Forms, Feedback, Overlays,
   Navigation and Data display, after the Scenarios page that opens the demo.
   Within a rubric the pages run from the simple to the composed and not
   alphabetically: an alphabet is an index, and the palette is already one
   (CONTEXT.md, "Rubric").

   The order follows the page, not taste: a sidebar sorted differently from
   what it jumps to confuses precisely when one trusts it. */
