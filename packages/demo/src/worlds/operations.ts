/**
 * The operations world: Quillmere, a platform on which small businesses take
 * online bookings, run as a set of services by six teams.
 *
 * The standing cast:
 * - `SERVICES` - eight services with their team, tier, latency objective and
 *   availability target;
 * - `ENGINEERS` - the people on call, and `ONCALL`, who is primary and
 *   secondary this week;
 * - `metrics(service)` - latency and error rate every five minutes of today up
 *   to now; Checkout has a bad half hour from 09:40;
 * - `INCIDENTS` - the last week's incidents, one of them still open;
 * - `ALERT_TYPES` and `ALERTS` - what the alert list shows at 10:30;
 * - `DOWNTIME_MINUTES` - each service's downtime this month, for its
 *   availability.
 *
 * "Now" is Tuesday, 17 March 2026, 10:30 local time. Plain data and small pure
 * functions, no imports: copy the file beside an example and it runs.
